# Nodes

A Node represents a single running instance of the Spacedrive core. It's the central orchestrator that holds references to all the core services and manages the application's state.

## Core Components

The Node structure contains several critical components:

### Essential Services

- **Data Directory**: Base path for all node data storage
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles node-specific settings and configuration
- **Libraries Manager**: Manages library instances and their data
- **Job System**: Coordinates background tasks and processing
- **Task System**: Handles lower-level task management
- **Locations Manager**: Manages file system locations and their monitoring
- **P2P Manager**: Handles peer-to-peer communication and synchronization
- **Event Bus**: Broadcasts core events throughout the system
- **Notifications**: Manages system notifications

### Optional Features

- **AI Image Labeller**: When enabled, provides image classification capabilities
- **Cloud Sync**: Manages synchronization with Spacedrive cloud services

## Initialization Flow

The Node initialization process follows these steps:

1. **Directory Setup**

   - Creates data directory if it doesn't exist
   - Initializes logging system
   - Sets up configuration storage

2. **Service Initialization**

   - Creates event broadcast channels
   - Initializes configuration manager
   - Sets up location management
   - Creates job and task systems
   - Establishes P2P connections
   - Initializes library management

3. **Feature Activation**
   - Restores backend feature flags
   - Initializes optional components (AI, cloud sync)
   - Sets up platform-specific features

## Key Features

### Event Management

- Centralized event bus for system-wide communication
- Broadcast channels for real-time updates
- Event-driven architecture for component coordination

### Configuration Management

- Persistent storage of node settings
- Feature flag management
- Environment-specific configurations

### Job Coordination

- Background task scheduling
- Resource management
- Progress tracking and reporting

### Library Integration

- Multi-library support
- Library initialization and management
- Cross-library operation coordination

### P2P Functionality

- Peer discovery and connection management
- Data synchronization between nodes
- Remote library access

## Platform Support

The Node system supports multiple platforms:

- Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Mobile (iOS, Android)
- Custom platform adaptations

## Error Handling

The Node implements comprehensive error handling through:

- `NodeError` enum for various failure scenarios
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Error propagation and logging
- Recovery mechanisms

## Best Practices

When working with Nodes:

1. **Initialization**

   - Always initialize nodes with proper error handling
   - Ensure all required directories exist
   - Handle platform-specific requirements

2. **Resource Management**

   - Use Arc for shared ownership
   - Implement proper shutdown procedures
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **Event Handling**

   - Subscribe to relevant event channels
   - Handle event bus overflow scenarios
   - Implement proper error handling for events

4. **Configuration**

   - Use the configuration manager for settings
   - Handle configuration updates properly
   - Validate configuration changes

5. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Use platform-agnostic APIs when possible
   - Handle platform-specific features appropriately
   - Test on all supported platforms

## Related Systems

Nodes interact closely with:

- Library system
- Location management
- Job processing
- P2P networking
- Cloud services
- File system operations
