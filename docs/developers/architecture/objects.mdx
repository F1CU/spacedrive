# Objects

Objects are files discovered on your devices and drives, but can also be virtual, existing only within Spacedrive.

All metadata associated with files in Spacedrive is linked to the Object for that file.

If two or more files are discovered that are identical, they are linked to the same Object in Spacedrive.

Some Objects are purely virtual, meaning they have no Path and are likely only used in a Space.

## Content Addressable Storage (CAS) IDs

A CAS ID is a unique identifier generated from a file's content using the blake3 hashing algorithm. The ID generation is optimized for different file sizes:

- For small files (~100KB): The entire file content is hashed
- For large files: A sampling approach is used:
  - First 8KB (header)
  - Last 8KB (footer)
  - 4 samples of 10KB each taken at regular intervals throughout the file

CAS IDs are used to:

- Link identical files to the same Object (deduplication)
- Track file changes
- Generate and cache thumbnails

## Hash Validation

Spacedrive uses a full checksum to validate file integrity. This is used for file sync, overwrite protection, and other sensitive operations.
